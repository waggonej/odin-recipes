    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>2-3 pound chuck roast</li>
        <li>yellow onions</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>pound of tiny potatoes</li>
        <li>carrots</li>
        <li>apple cider</li>
        <li>balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>dijon mustard</li>
        <li>fresh thyme</li>
        <li>fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>bone broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Cooking Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the onions, carrots, and potatoes in the slow cooker, 
            forming a little nest for the roast to lay in.
        </li>
        <li>Before placing your roast in the pot, rub your roast down with some salt and pepper, 
            then sear it on all sides in a hot pan on the stove with butter or olive oil. 
            This will create basically a crust around your roast and will keep the 
            flavor of it while its cooking in the slow cooker. Its tempting to skip 
            this step but don't! It really makes a difference.
        </li>
        <li>Once your roast is all seared, place it in the slow cooker 
            along with the remaining ingredients. Cook on low for 8 hours. 
            Future you will love past you for this one.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
